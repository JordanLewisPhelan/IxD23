  <strong>Goals of Project</strong>
  </div></para1>
  
  <para2><div class="para">
  <br>The concept of this project is to aim to make Learning Apps more interactive and engaging, this is<br>
  due to retention rates increasing as you feel more engaged.
  </div></para2>
  
   <para3><div class="para">
 	<br>The Process we will be looking into here on this project is dubbed, "Gamification", which is<br>
    the application of game elements, e.g, Rewards, visisble stat tracking, i.e, Leaderboards and<br>
    attaching it to learning, in this case apps. The goal is to increase retention, enjoyment and motivation.
  </div></para3>
  
  <para4><div class="para">
 	<br>This Project is broken down into several categories(of which is displayed in the upper left handside box for viewing 
    courtesy minus the Home button, we are currently here now), such as, The competitvie Audit which discusses how several apps perform at this 	task of gamification to their apps, The wireframes of the project, Prototypes and user usability tests, the tests should help figure out where 		the faults or the boons of the apps mentioned and where the prototypes can improve.
  </div></para4>
  
  <para5><div class="para">
 	<br>Wireframing and prototypes will be where a breakdown of user design ideas and how <br>to make it functionally viable while not seeming cluttered or messy interface<br> wise, this is to ensure a smooth experience for the user.
  </div></para5>
  
  <para6><div class="para">
 	<br>Usability Testing was crucial, as it is one thing if the creators can use it, but if everyone cant pick it up and understand it easily, was it really designed good enough? So to gather information we went and gave it to people to test, we used their feedback and placed it in this segment to show what the prototype did right and where it failed.
  </div></para6>
  
    <pConc> 
   <br><br> Overall, the aim aim of this project and prototype is to not only make a an effective product<br> but an enjoyable one. 
    Ultimately, improving the users learning outcomes and to help retain said information learned.
